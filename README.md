At one tutorial we talked with mihkel that we should implement tests in this fashion:

1. ⁠Base model performance
2. ⁠Base model + in context learning performance
3. ⁠Base model + in context learning + schema linking performance
4. ⁠⁠Fine-tuned model
5. ⁠⁠Fine-tuned + in context learning
6. ⁠Fine-tuned + in context learning + schema linking performance
